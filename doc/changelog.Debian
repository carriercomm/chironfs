chironfs (1.0.0) debian; urgency=low

       * Initial packaging
         lintian is bothering me with the copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl
         error. But, this package is licensed with GPLv3 which does not exist in my 
         /usr/share/common-licenses directory so both I do not have anything to reference
         there and I must keep this license file in the package doc directory.
