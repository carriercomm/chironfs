<H2>Chapter&nbsp;1.&nbsp;How to Install and Test Chiron FS</H2><A NAME="install1"></A>
<H2 LANG="en">a) Obtaining and Installing Chiron FS 
</H2>
<P LANG="en"><A NAME="install2"></A>
You may download ChironFS from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chironfs/downloads/list">Google Code</a>.
There are some choices there:
<ul class='stdlist' style='margin-left: 3em;'>
 <li>Source code, both as a tarball or RPM format;</li>
 <li>Binary
   <ul class='stdlist' style='margin-left: 6em;'>
      <li>i386, both DEB and RPM format;</li>
      <li>64bit, both amd64/DEB and x86_64/RPM format</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
For the tarball, named chironfs-&lt;current_version&gt;.tar.gz, you will 
have to make sure that your system have FUSE installed, BOTH BINARY and
DEVELOPMENT files. If you have a recent distribution you probably
have it installed or can do it with few commands like apt-get, yum,
yast, etc. If you don't have it you may download it from its 
<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">site</a>. 
</P>
<P LANG="en">Unpack it wherever you want and you will have a
directory named chironfs-&lt;current_version&gt;.</P>
<P LANG="en">Just enter the directory and compile it with the
commands:</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P LANG="en">cd /path/to/source/chironfs-&lt;current_version&gt; 
</P>
<P LANG="en">./configure [any configure options you want]</P>
<P LANG="en">make</P>
<P LANG="en">make install</P>
</div>
<P LANG="en">
For the source in RPM format, just type:
<div class='codebox'>
<P LANG="en">
rpmbuild -ba chironfs-&lt;current_version&gt;.src.rpm
</P>
</div>
and this will compile ChironFS, generating a chironfs-&lt;current_version&gt;&lt;your_architecture&gt;.rpm.
Then you may install it with this command:
<div class='codebox'>
<P LANG="en">
rpm -i chironfs-&lt;current_version&gt;-&lt;your_architecture&gt;.rpm
</P>
</div>
<P LANG="en">
For the binaries in RPM format, just type:
<div class='codebox'>
<P LANG="en">
rpm -i chironfs-&lt;current_version&gt;-&lt;architecture&gt;.rpm
</P>
</div>
</P>
<P LANG="en">
For the binaries in DEB format, just type:
<div class='codebox'>
<P LANG="en">
dpkg -i chironfs_&lt;current_version&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.deb
</P>
</div>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>b) Testing Chiron FS</H2><A NAME="test"></A>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Create 3 directories, one for the virtual filesystem and two for
the replicas and do the mount with the commands;</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>mkdir /virtual /real1 /real2</P>
<P>chironfs /real1=/real2 /virtual</P>
</div>
<P>Confirm they are correctly mounted with the command:<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>df</P>
</div>
<p></p>
<P>You should see a line like this:</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>/real1=/real2&nbsp;&nbsp; 138456396 130613500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
809640 100% /virtual</P>
</div>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Try to create/modify/delete some files in /virtual and check for
the reflections in /real1 and /real2. <BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>At this point you may be convinced that you have everything you
need to start replicating your files. So umount it with the command:<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>fusermount -u /virtual</P>
</div>
<H2>Chapter 2. Using Chiron FS</H2><A NAME="using"></A>
<P>In the test above, we just made the simplest use of Chiron FS, but
we did not used 2 options that, despite being OPTIONAL, I think that
in production environment they are indeed essential. <BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>First, in a corporative environment, we want to share the access
to many users. But, FUSE were implemented with individual user
defaults and, this way, only the user who mounted the virtual
system has the needed visibility, others just see the empty mount
point. So, to allow others, we MUST use the FUSE option allow_other.
<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Secondly, we want to be reported if some replica fails. The system
will continue running, but we don't want to discover the failures
when the last replica fails and the system stops. We want to get the
failed replica up and running as soon as possible! So we need to
activate the logs! <BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So, the example above should get better if we change the mount
command to this:</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>chironfs --fuseoptions allow_other --log /var/log/chironfs.log
/real1=/real2 /virtual</P>
</div>
<P>If you want more replicas, 3 for example, type:
<div class='codebox'>
<P>chironfs --fuseoptions allow_other --log /var/log/chironfs.log
/real1=/real2=/real3 /virtual</P>
</div>
</P>
<P>Now suppose, in this example, that /real2 is a known slow 
filesystem, I mean much slower than /real1 and /real3. When
ChironFS has to write data, it must write to all of them. But
when it has to read, it chooses just one to read. Then, we don't
want that ChironFS give equal chances of reading to /real2. As
ChironFS uses a round robin algorithm, if we don't tell it that
/real2 is slow, it will read from /real2 at each third read. So,
to avoid this, give a low priority to real2 and ChironFS will
read from it only if /real1 AND /real3 fails. To make this, type
a colon just before the /real2 path:
<div class='codebox'>
<P>chironfs --fuseoptions allow_other --log /var/log/chironfs.log
/real1=<span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 14px;">:</span>/real2=/real3 /virtual</P>
</div>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Chapter 3. Putting in fstab</H2><A NAME="fstab"></A>
<P>So, to mount it automatically at boot time, simply add lines to
your /etc/fstab file as shown in the example below. The first column
must start with "chironfs#" followed, without spaces, by the list
of replicas separated by equal signs. The second column is you mount
point. The third column must be "fuse". The fourth column are the
fuse and chironfs options separated by colons. The last two columns
are fstab options and works just as you can see in the fstab
documentation.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>chironfs#/real1=/real2 /virtual fuse
allow_other,log=/var/log/chironfs.log 0 0</P>
</div>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Chapter 4. Some Examples</H2><A NAME="examples"></A>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>So let's see some real world examples:</P>
<H2 LANG="en">a) File and web servers</H2><A NAME="srv"></A>
<P LANG="en"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en">In this example we will see 3 different solutions to
replication of data on a LAN with 2 servers, tipically a file server
and a web server.</P>
<P LANG="en"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2 LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=4>i) Network storage</FONT></H2><A NAME="net"></A>
<P LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=3>In this solution, we will need 2 more
servers, they will be the servers' servers, sharing their filesystems
using any protocol like NFS, SSHFS, etc. For the purpose of the
example, we will use NFS. The servers' servers will have the
hostnames set to nfs1 and nfs2 and will export the directory /data.
The file and web servers will have their hostnames set to fileserver
and webserver, respectively and will be the users' servers.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=3>Make the local mount point for all the real
and virtual filesystems in each of the users's servers:</FONT></P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=3>mkdir /real1 /real2 /virtual</FONT></P>
</div>
<P LANG="en"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=3>Update their fstabs by adding these 3
lines:</FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>nfs1:/data /real1 nfs auto 0 0</P>
<P>nfs2:/data /real2 nfs auto 0 0</P>
<P>chironfs#/real1=/real2 /virtual fuse
allow_other,log=/var/log/chironfs.log 0 0</P>
</div>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Now you may setup your users' servers. Follow the specific
instructions of the services you want to setup, attempting to make
the fileserver export the /virtual directory to your users and
putting the webserver's  documents trees below the /virtual
directory.</P>
<P LANG="en"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=3>For achieving no single point of failure
you should provide network hardware backups, like 2 NICs for each
server, connected to redundant bridges.</FONT></P>

<H2 LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=4>ii) Local storage</FONT></H2><A NAME="local"></A>
<P LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=3>In this solution, we will make the users'
server be the servers' servers too, sharing their filesystems using
any protocol like NFS, SSHFS, etc. For the purpose of the example, we
will use NFS again. The file and the web servers will have their

the users' servers.</FONT></P>

<H2>Chapter 5. Replica Failures</H2><A NAME="fail"></A>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en"><FONT SIZE=3>Anytime some of your replica fails chironfs
attempts to make your systems running. If the fail occurs during a
read operation, chironfs tries to read from some other replica and in
case of success, returns to the caller with no error. In this case,
chironfs logs the event if you mounted with the recommended –log
option. If the fail occurs during a write operation, chironfs
continues trying to write in the other replicas. If at least one of
the replicas succeeds in the write, chironfs returns to the caller
with no error. But this time, chironfs logs the event AND disable the
failed replicas. It means that no further reads or writes will be
made from or to it. At this point, you have to make you monitor
policy to be reported of the event. You may use any software, like
logwatch, for this purpose. After correcting the fail cause on the
replica failed server, YOU MUST PROVIDE BY YOURSELF THE
RESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSISTENCY OF THE DATA ON THE FAILED SERVER. I
SUGGEST THE USE OF RSYNC TO UPDATE THE DATA. <U><B>THIS STEP MUST BE
DONE BEFORE PUTTING THE REPLICA IN ENABLED STATE AGAIN</B></U>,
OTHERWISE YOU WILL CORRUPT YOUR DATA IN ALL OTHER REPLICAS. To
restablish the use of the replica after the consistency recover
procedure, you will have to umount your chironfs virtual filesystem
and mount it again.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Chapter 6. Hash, file descriptors and ulimit considerations</H2><A NAME="hash"></A>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The hash table functions currently being used are the Robert Jenkins' 32 bit integer 
hash function as found in this <a href="http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm"
>Twang's doc</a> just adapted to the C language. The 64 bit mix function was taken
from there too.</P>
<P>In prior version of ChironFS, the size of the hash table was equal to the file-max
kernel parameter. It has been lowered to minimize memory usage. This was done without
sacrificing performance due to the great distribution achieved by these hash functions.</P>
<P>The file-max kernel parameter is system wide and if all the file-system would be
ChironFSed and with a minimal of two replicas we would need only 33% of the old table 
space. Since the new hash functions are much better distributed and are good enough
until 80% of the space used, I decided to use a file-max proportional allocation,
using the maximum power of 2 less than 50% of file-max.</p>
<P>The <a href="#stats">stats</a> showed a low collision rate for 50% of table
usage (about 18% of file-max in my box, which means that, using two replicas,
I was using 54% of the system file descriptors).</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>Statistics</H3><A NAME="stats"></a>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>
I made a hash test program that simulates file descriptors allocations
and counts, for each hash slot, the total colisions, directly from hash
caculations or indirect when, due a previous colision the system tried
to allocate the next address and found it already allocated.
</P>
<P>
Each pixel of the graphics below represents one address. The whites are
free slots, the greens are allocated but without any colision. The reds
are addresses with just one colision and the blacks are the ones with 
more than one colision.
</P>
<P>
I tested with three tables: small, medium and large. The small is the one
currently in use by ChironFS and is sized as the maximum power of 2 less
than 50% of file-max. The medium is sized the double of the small table.
The large is 4 times the medium one. The tests were done allocating 50% 
of the small table, 25% of the medium and 6,25% of the large one.
In my system, the file-max is 365718. So the small table is 128K 
file descriptors, the medium is 256K and the large is 1M. The allocations
totalized 64K file descriptors.
</P>
<P><br /></P>
<P class="figure"><img src="small.gif" /><br />
Figure 1. Small table allocations. 
</P> 
<P style="font-size: 16pt;"><br /></P>
<P class="figure"><img src="med.gif" /><br />
Figure 2. Medium table allocations. 
</P> 
<P style="font-size: 16pt;"><br /></P>
<P class="figure"><img src="large.gif" /><br />
Figure 3. Large table allocations.
</P> 
<P>
So, there is an acceptable colision rate at a high level of concurrently
opened files (64k ChironFS file descriptors, using the minimal two
replicas, actually means 192k (53%) of the 360k file-max limit).  
</P>
<P>
But the discussion doesn't ends here. After this explanation about
the management of the file descriptors and pushing them to the limits,
we shall consider how the system treats all that stuff.
</P>
<P>
The point is that the file-max kernel parameter is the system wide limit
to opened file descriptors. <span class="emphasize">But the system limits 
the amount of opened files by process too! And ChironFS is also under 
these limitations.</span> When you mount ChironFS, it will try to raise
system parameters to the values needed. But it will succeed only if it 
is running as root! If you run ChironFS as unprivileged user you will 
have to raise the maximum opened files per process as root editing the
file /etc/security/limits.conf making sure it has the lines below to,
for example, set the maximum opened files to 65536 for user "www":
</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>
www             soft    nofile          65536<br />
www             hard    nofile          65536
</p>
</div>
<P>
Note that you have to login again to make the changes valid. If you are
in an X-terminal you have to close your X session, login again and then
open you X-terminal.
</p>
<P>
<span class="emphasize">Atention! Check the documentation of the software
you pretend to run using ChironFS. For example, if your software documentation
says to you that it needs 30000 open files and tells you to change the
configuration at /etc/security/limits.conf and the user who will mount ChironFS
is an unprivileged user (not root), you have to configure the limits of this
user too using the formula: 2 * NF * NR + 6 (2 times number of files times number
of replicas plus 6).</span>
</P>
<P>
For example, to be able to open 30000 files replicated over 3 replicas, you have 
to set your /etc/security/limits.conf to 180006 (2 * 30000 * 3 + 6). Then your
/etc/security/limits.conf, for the user "someuser", for example, should be as
this: 
</P>
<div class='codebox'>
<P>
someuser      soft    nofile          180006<br />
someuser      hard    nofile          180006
</p>
</div>
<P>
So, that's all to make it run properly. Now if you are curious about why make all 
this math, the reasons are:
<ul class='stdlist' style='margin-left: 3em;'>
<li>1) each file opened by a file in the virtual mount
point makes ChironFS do an open in each replica, one file descriptor is consumed by 
each one;
</li>
<li>2) multiply everything by 2 because ChironFS uses a hash table to store the
file descriptors of the real filesystems and it is power of two sized and then, ChironFS
gets the value of ulimit, sets all bits (which will, in most cases, result in a value
higher than the ulimit) and rotate it right (divide by two) and, this way, if gets an
ulimit of 90000, it will divide by 3, obtaining 30000, set all bits and rotate, obtaining
16383 and your application will be limited by this number, not 30000. So, multiplying
by two will make ChironFS end up with a result of 32767, which will guarantee that your
application will be able to open the 30000 files;

<li>3) the 6 is for extra file descriptors
reserved to be used by ChironFS like, for example, the log file.
