* make a cache type replica which copies contents on demand
* Support for extended attributes
* automatic resync of failed replicas
  + command line option indicating a script to make the resync
    at mount time, valid only if there is a log file
    - deliver scripts:
      . rsync based script
* Implement two optional mutual exclusive policies
  when the replicas have different sizes:
  + Report "partition" size/free space as the least
    value reported by the replicas. This approach
    prevents having a disabled replica when it gets
    "disk full" error while the others could succeed
  + Report "partition" size/free space as the biggest
    value reported by the replicas. This approcah
    prevents your systems stopping when the smaller
    replica gets "disk full" error. So the replica 
    disabled log message raises the alarm in a "dead
    canary" way
* Make more tests specially in case of failure detection.
* /chironctl pseudo file to manage chironfs in runtime
  file attribs define who can manage
* make statistics
* better load balance algorithm using the statistics to
  choose from which replica we will try to read
* Slow replicas slow down the entire system
  + develop a threaded version with asynchronous rw
